   //Scroll to the bottom to see the Optional Activity additions.
    
   //Here's an example of how this could go:
   
   //We need the variables to hold user input.
   int num1 = 0;
   int num2 = 0;
   
   //Now we need to tell the user to input the first number:
   cout << "Please input an integer:\n";
   //receive the first number:
   cin >> num1;
   
   //Now we need to tell the user to input the second number:
   cout << "Please input another integer:\n";
   //Receive the second number:
   cin >> num2; 
   
   //Now let's put the addition of the two numbers 
   //into a variable:
   int sum = num1 + num2;
   
   //Now let's output the answer to the user:
   cout << num1 << " + " << num2 << " = " << sum << "!\n";
   //Notice how we output the two numbers
   //the user input as well as the answer. This helps
   //assure the user that the input was received successfully. 
   
   //Optional Activity begins here:
   //Subtraction:
   int difference = num1 - num2;
   cout << num1 << " - " << num2 << " = " << difference << "!\n";
   
   //Multiplication:
   int multiply = num1 * num2;
   cout << num1 << " * " << num2 << " = " << multiply << "!\n";
   
   //Division:
   //if we want a decimal answer, we need to convert the
   //"int" variables into "double" variables. One way to do this
   //is to create two new variables using the values from
   //the first two variables.
   double dec1 = num1;
   double dec2 = num2;\
   //This will convert the int value in num1 
   //to an equivalent "double" value. (e.g. it would convert 
   //6 to 6.0)
   
   double division = dec1 / dec2;
   cout << dec1 << " / " << dec2 << " = " << division << "!\n";
   
   return 0;

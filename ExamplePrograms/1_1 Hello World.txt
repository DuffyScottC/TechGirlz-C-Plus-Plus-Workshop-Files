		   //like 1, 2, 5, or 235. The "int" means that the "main function" 
		   //"returns" an integer when the program is done. 
		   //This will be further explained later.
{ //This is called a curly bracket. This represents the start of the "main function".

   cout << "Hello World" << endl; //This line of code actually does something! 
   //It prints the words "Hello World" to the console window.
   //What does that mean? Why don't you run the code and find out! 
   //Ask your instructor how to run your code)
   //As you can see, a little window (called the console window) 
   //opens up and displays the words "Hello World". 
   
   return 0; //This is that "return" thing I mentioned above. 
   //This "main function" returns an integer value (0) to let the 
   //programmer know that the program executed successfully. 
   
} //This curly bracket represents the end of the "main function".

   int num1 = 0;
   int num2 = 0;
   
   //Now we need to tell the user to input the first number:
   cout << "Please input an integer:\n";
   //recieve the first number:
   cin >> num1;
   
   //Now we need to tell the user to input the second number:
   cout << "Please input another integer:\n";
   //Recieve the second number:
   cin >> num2;
   
   //Now let's put the addition of the two numbers 
   //into a variable:
   int sum = num1 + num2;
   
   //Now let's output the answer to the user:
   cout << num1 << " + " << num2 << " = " << sum << "!\n";
   //Notice how we output the two numbers
   //the user input as well as the answer. This helps
   //assure the user that the input was recieved successfully.

        //So as long as the variable i is greater than or equal to 0 (i >= 0) then the following code will run.
        //Since "i" starts out as 10, and 10 is greater than 0, the code runs.

        //This loop runs again and again, subtracting 1 from "i" until finally, "i" is 0. Then the while loop will run one last time,
        //and it will subract 1 from "i" making it equal to -1.
        //Since -1 is not greater than or equal to 0, the while-loop's condition becomes false, and the loop ends.

    //Be wary of infinite loops. If we had not subtracted 1 from "i" each time the loop ran, then the condition will
    //have never been false. The loop would continue looping until the program crashed, or until you stopped it.

    //Here is where you place the "Blast off!" statement:
    cout << "Blast off!\n";
